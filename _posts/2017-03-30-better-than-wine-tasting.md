title: Better Than Wine Tasting
---
"I'm sorry, honey," I said, giving my wife a guilty frown. "I just need to get a bit more done before we leave."

"What the fuck, Sam?" Silvia exclaimed, her voice sharp with agitation. "I've been driving for five hours to pick you up here in the middle of nowhere. And now I have to sit around and wait for you?"

"I'm really sorry. Just another hour. Two at the most."

Silvia raised her sunglasses up to her forehead, making sure her deep brown eyes had my full attention. "So at least three then?"

"No, probably not. I just need to complete my part so Joel and Mark can finish the script over the weekend."

I felt the guilt creeping into the back of my mind. I knew I was disappointing her, but I didn't want to stop now that I was on a flow. Going up to this cabin with my two friends and co-writers had proven to be a great idea. The three of us had been trying for ages to write a script for a TV series pilot. We had struggled before, but had a massive breakthrough over the past week, inspired by the combination of fresh air and lack of other distractions. Throughout the week, we had come up with a plot for a crime drama with enough twists and angles to make it unique. Finally, we were getting somewhere.

Silvia stared at me in silence, her jaw tense. "Fine," she said eventually. "So, what am I supposed to do while I wait for the almighty genius to finish?"

The sarcasm made me somewhat relieved. It was the silence I dreaded.

"I think Joel and Mark are going for a swim," I said, loud enough that my two friends could hear me from inside the cabin. "Maybe you could go with them?"

As if on cue, Joel and Mark emerged.

"Hello Mrs. Anderson," they greeted her, kissing her on the cheek.

Like myself, my friends were just in their board shorts. The weather had been great all week, and none of us had bothered to put a shirt on.

"We were just about to head down to the lake," Joel said. "Do you want to join us?"

"That sounds good, right honey?" I chimed in enthusiastically.

Silvia sighed "Well, we were meant to go on a tour around the wine district, remember? So I didn't exactly see any reason to pack my bikini. Now, if you had told me we were going to hang around here I..."

"Couldn't you just go in your underwear? Or if you prefer, I'm sure no one would mind if you skinny dip," I joked in an impetuous attempt to divert the attention from my shortcomings.

I regretted it straight away. Joel and Mark laughed nervously, but Silvia didn't seem amused in the slightest. She stared at me with fiery eyes, raising her finger at me. As she parted her lips, I braced myself for one of her rants. They usually included a mixture of English and Italian curses.

But instead she just lowered her finger. "Fine. I'll leave you alone." She lowered her sunglasses back to her eyes, making her expression difficult to read. "What way to the lake guys?"

Mark stroked his beard, something he often did in times of uncertainty.

"It's just down this way," Joel said hesitantly.

Without a word, Silvia turned and headed down the track towards the lake, her raven black ponytail bouncing with her stride.

"Shall I put your bag inside?" I shouted after her, trying to get back on her good side. "It's going to get stinking hot in the car."

"Yes," she said, not looking back.

The guys gave me a confused look, and I mouthed a "thank you" to them. The way I saw it, I had gotten off easy. They followed Silvia down the winding path into the surrounding forest, and I returned to my laptop.

"Now where was I?" I muttered out loud to myself.

I stared at the text I had been working on before Silvia arrived, trying my best to concentrate. But my own text no longer seemed to make sense, words just blurring into meaningless statements about a fictional innuendo I no longer cared about. The focus was gone. I had disappointed my wife, and I knew she wasn't happy with me.

Sometimes I thought she was too good for me. She couldn't have been more supportive when I decided to quit my dead-end job and pursue my lifelong dream of becoming a writer. Sure, she had a hot temper, but that was just part of what made her so enticing.

I tried to shake the distractions out of my head to focus on the script. But I couldn't even remember what the story of the pilot was anymore.

"I'm sure no one would mind if you skinny dip."

My own words kept spinning in my head. I should have known better than to say stupid things like that. Sure, I had bantered along those lines in private before, teasing her to show off a bit. It was my own awkward way of letting her know just how privileged I felt to have such a sexy wife. But now I had said it in front of my friends. Surely she understood that it was just a stupid joke?

As if reading my mind, I heard my wife giggling in the distance. At least she seemed to be in a better mood already.

I tried one last time to focus on the script, but soon gave up.

"Ah, fuck it!" I said as I slammed the laptop shut. The inspiration was long gone.

Weighing my options, I decided the best thing to do was to chase after my wife and tell her that we could leave straight away. Hopefully she would forgive me and we could continue with our planned weekend of wine tasting.

I hurried down the path to catch up with Silvia and friends, making sure not to trip on the uneven ground. It seemed no one maintained the path, and it was just trampled by visitors to the cabin.

My stupid joke reappeared in my head. "I'm sure no one would mind if you skinny dip." Why on earth had I said that? Surely I didn't expect my wife to go for a naked swim with my friends? And how would I react if she actually did it?

It appeared they hadn't been in much of a hurry, and I soon spotted them up ahead. They were standing near the edge of an outcrop, overlooking the panorama view of the lake and surrounding forest. I had gone there a few times during the past week with my friends, and I knew the scenery was stunning. Joel seemed to be pointing out some of the sights, and Silvia stretched her neck to look in the direction he guided her.

I found myself taking in a different sight — the enticing view of my beautiful wife. She really was a stunning woman, and I admired the curves of her ass as she leaned over to look down the cliff they were standing on. I couldn't help smirking to myself when I noticed that Mark, who was standing a bit further back from the edge, did the same.

Silvia wasn't exactly dressed for a stroll in the forest. She wore a tight black skirt, accompanied by a fashionable red blouse. Even from a distance, I could see her painted toenails sparkling in the sun. Her delicate sandals were far from the casual model my friends and I were wearing, the straps reaching up to clasp her slim ankles. They also provided some elevation under her heels, which did a great job of accentuating her slender legs, but was probably less suited for hiking rough terrain.

It was strangely thrilling to observe my wife from afar. I approached them with careful steps, hoping to get a bit closer before they turned around and spotted me.

But my plans changed as I accidentally stepped on a dry twig. Acting on instinct, I ducked behind a rock as I heard the cracking sound.

"Did you hear anything?" I heard my wife ask.

"Yeah, probably a deer or something," Joel said. "They are quite common here."

Silvia seemed to accept the answer. "OK. Shall we continue? It's getting pretty hot."

I sighed deeply at my own stupidity. What could possibly have prompted me to hide like that? My intention was to get back on my wife's good side, and now I was spying on her like some pervert. Or maybe like some obsessive and jealous husband? Was I subconsciously attempting to find out if she was actually on her way to go skinny dipping with my friends?

Either way, I had to put a stop to this foolish behavior. But on the other hand, I couldn't just jump up straight away from behind the rock — then she'd know I'd been spying on her. I couldn't risk that if I wanted to have a nice weekend with my wife. Thus, I waited until they had disappeared into the forest path again before emerging. As I followed them, I convinced myself that nothing out of the ordinary was going on. I just had to apologize to my wife and we could be on our way.

I soon heard their voices again.

"Are you sure you don't mind?" Silvia said. "It's just that I didn't dress for a hike like this."

I didn't hear his friends replying, but no one seemed to protest. Silvia's words intrigued me. What could they possibly mind? I spotted the three of them in a clearing, and rather than doing what I had decided, I hunkered behind the hump I was coming up over and peered at them.

"What are you doing?" I asked myself. "You were meant to put a stop to this!"

It wasn't too late to just approach them, and I was just about to do so when I noticed what Silvia was doing. She was unbuttoning her blouse! One by one she undid her buttons, and I saw my friends pretending not to look. How could I blame them?

"Are we coming back the same way?" she asked casually as she slid the blouse off her shoulders.

I froze in my hunkered position, captivated by the strangely sensual sight of my wife's unexpected exposure. The bra was cut low, and her chest swayed alluringly as she walked over to a tree at the edge of the clearing.

"Yes, this is the only trail," Joel said after a long pause. It seemed he was mesmerized as well.

Silvia hung her blouse on a branch. "Do you think it's safe to hang this here and pick it up on the way back? I rather not carry it with me."

"Yes, should be fine," Mark said. "We haven't seen anyone else around all week."

I felt a confusing rush come over me as Silvia continued on the path down towards the lake. There was my wife parading around in the wild in her bra. It was white, contrasting against her olive skin. I didn't recognize it, but from what I could tell from a distance it was a laced model, framing her ample chest. I guessed she had bought it for my benefit later, but now she was giving my friends the first view.

I tried to rid myself of the fascination I felt, reasoning that walking around in her bra was of course rather innocent. Had I stumbled on a strange woman in her bra on a hike on a warm summer's day, I probably wouldn't have though much about it.

But she wasn't a stranger. She was my adored wife, walking around in her sexy bra with my colleagues and friends.

I waited until they were safely around the corner before I continued to follow them. As I crossed to the other side of the clearing they had been standing in, I stopped and looked at the red blouse hanging before me on the branch. It was the evidence that Silvia was currently walking around in just her bra further down the road. And she had no intentions of covering up, at least not before coming back to this location. Would she be equally relaxed about her wardrobe when I caught up with them? And did I want her to cover up?

I decided to bring the blouse with me. Wouldn't that have been the most expected thing to do if I had just stumbled upon it while trying to catch up with them?

But the closer I got to their voices, the less certain I felt that I should just approach them as if nothing was out of the ordinary. Would Silvia actually want me to? Would she feel embarrassed if her husband caught her walking around in her bra?

I still hadn't made up my mind when I next spotted them, and lacking a clear plan I ducked behind the root of a tree. As I peered over the root, I felt my heart skip a beat. My wife was in that very moment unzipping her skirt.

They had just reached the part of the trail where the terrain was particularly difficult, and I could understand how it would be challenging to make it down that section in her tight skirt. But couldn't she just have hitched it up or, if she really had to remove it, put it back on once she was past the difficult part?

But she did no such thing. She stepped out of her skirt and folded it neatly. Placing it on a rock, she continued down the path in just her matching underwear. And of course, she was wearing string panties — she never allowed for any lines when she wore a tight skirt — leaving her round ass almost completely exposed.

I felt a hint of jealousy at the notion of my wife showing off her goods. But that sensation was overshadowed by a rush of excitement from watching her walking around brazenly in just her underwear. Both notions were amplified when she all of a suddenly needed to steady herself with her hand in Mark's as they walked down the rocky path.

I sat for a while to collect myself. Why was this so erotic to watch? Of course, she was a sexy woman, and I always felt blessed when seeing her in various stages of undress. But watching her parade around like this was exciting on a different level. Part of me felt I should run after her and suggest she'd cover up. But there was a stronger part that desired to watch her more.

I tried to rationalize the situation, concluding that she was just doing what I had suggested — going for a swim in her underwear. It was a little bit odd that she had decided to strip down halfway to the lake, but her clothes weren't fit for hiking along a trail like this. I hurried after them, taking her skirt with me as I passed it. The way I saw it, I couldn't just bring her the blouse and leave her skirt behind.

The path increasingly meandered outside of the forest into the open areas next to the lake. It made it possible to watch them for longer periods before rushing after them again. Each time I sat back and observed them, I was mesmerized by the alluring sight. Silvia always had a certain grace in the way she walked, and now was no difference.

Watching them for longer periods also meant I had to chase after them at a very brisk pace

to catch up. Each time I got increasingly worried that I might lose them. As I hurried, I spotted something dangling from a branch next to the trail. At first I couldn't make out what it was, and in my haste I almost passed it without paying any further attention to it.

But something made me stop in my tracks. What was that? White fabric, straps, lace...

I gasped as it sunk in. It was undeniably a bra hanging there next to the trail, swaying lightly in the gentle summer breeze. Was it really hers? A part of me thought that she would never walk around topless in the wilderness. But another, equally rational part of me thought about the odds of finding a bra that looked just like hers, hanging on a branch minutes after she had passed that point. It was clasped around the branch it was hanging from. I undid it and studied it. I was quite familiar with her regular selection of underwear, but she had been wearing a new set. The cups looked too small for her, but the bra I saw her wearing was cut very low, making it hard to judge the size. I read the tag. D-cups seemed right, but I realized I didn't actually know what size she usually wore.

I shook the speculation out of my head. There was no point thinking about it further when the answer was walking just minutes down the road. I scurried after them.

I slowed down as I heard Silvia's voice, taking care that didn't hear my steps. Long gone was the intention to run up to them and pretend I was only then just catching up. I crouched down, hiding behind rocks as I moved closer. They appeared to have stopped walking, and I guessed they had reached another open area with a good view of the lake. As I drew near, I heard Silvia talking about sights she was pointing out. My heart beat rapidly, and I knew it wasn't just from running. I was desperate to find out if my wife was in fact topless in broad daylight.

It was too risky to move closer on the increasingly open trail, and I decided to backtrack and crawl over a hill that overlooked the open area where I heard their voices coming from. On my hands and knees I crawled, hoping the sound of dry leaves and twigs wouldn't be too loud. They were only chatting sporadically now, but they still didn't seem to move. Ever so carefully, I peeked over the edge.

And there she was, with her tits in all their naked glory on display for the world to see. I realized with excited perplexity that this was how I had hoped to find her. She was acting as if it was perfectly normal to stand there with nothing but her tiny panties to cover her body, pointing out something in the distance to Joel and Mark. She was standing with her side towards me, and even from afar I could see the detailed contours of her breasts. Her noticeably erect nipples were also pointing towards the scenery before her. It was a captivating sight.

It was difficult to see exactly where she was looking behind her glasses, and I quickly ducked down as she turned her head in my direction. I didn't want to get caught, partly because it would anger her if she found out I was prying on her, but the primary reason was that I didn't want to stop watching her. My head was spinning. Had she even bothered coming up with an excuse for removing her bra, or was she just openly flaunting herself?

As thrilling as it was to pry on her exposure, there was also a sense of betrayal to what she was doing. Not so much because she was showing off her tits to my friends — if I was honest with myself, this made her exposure even more thrilling to watch. What bothered me was that she was doing it without me. I had teasingly encouraged her to show off on numerous occasions, but she would always turn me down. Hunkering out of sight from my topless wife, I began recalling an occasion when she had turned the tables on me.

We had been hanging out on the beach with a group of friends, and while the others were swimming, I dared her to remove her bikini top. I was lying on my back, grinning up at her as she knelt beside me, applying sunscreen to her arms. She gave me a raised eyebrow, and to my surprise she began slowly pulling at the rosette in the back. My mouth fell open, and I stared with captivated eyes. But just as the knot came undone, she lay down on her stomach next to me. She had a pleased smirk on her face.

"Come on, honey," I pushed. "Don't be a spoilsport!"

She condescendingly patted my cheek. "Oh, was my little pervert getting his hopes up?"

I grunted in defeat.

"Is that what you want?" she mocked. "Showing off my tits?"

I was dumbfounded as she called me out. I wasn't sure myself how sincere my suggestion was.

"Do you want them to drool over me?" she continued. "Maybe I should show them more than my tits? Do you want me to strip down here on beach and let everybody see me naked?"

She leaned in close, whispering with exaggerated sensuality in my ear.

"Maybe seeing me isn't enough? What if one of them wants to touch me? Would you like that — watching your wife get fondled by someone in public?"

Her hand had been traveling from my face down over my torso and was now lingering above the hem of my shorts.

"And then we could invite someone back to our place," she continued. "What a great idea, sharing me with one of your friends. You could fuck my mouth while he takes me from behind!"

She held her mouth open as a mock invite, at the same time suggestively pushing her ass up. I knew she was just toying with me, but I still couldn't utter a single word.

"You could take turns fucking me, and then finish by covering me with cum. Just like in porn! Do you want that, honey? To make your wife act like a whoreish little slut?"

She reached down and briefly squeezed my erection.

"You might want to hide that," she said softly. "They're coming back."

I snapped back to reality and quickly turned to my stomach as I saw our friends exiting the water. I shook my head in disbelief. Silvia's elegant surface concealed a surprisingly wicked mind. She really was a fire-cracker sometimes, for better or for worse.

"So which friend do you want to share me with?" she asked.

I stared at her with astonishment, and for a moment I thought she was serious. But she broke out in a smug grin, giggling at herself.

"Oh, don't look so disappointed," she said. "You know you couldn't go through with it. If you actually shared me with one of your friends, your vivid imagination would soon reckon that I might have developed some meaningful connection to him. And then you'd start getting suspicious. Yada, yada, yada..."

She was always ahead of me. Moments before I hadn't even realized how thrilling the idea of sharing her could be, and she was already explaining to me why it was a bad idea. I had to admit she had a point, even though a part of me wanted to further explore this newfound revelation. She acted as if she wasn't affected herself by the escalating scenario she had portrayed, but I had a sense there was more to it. She certainly seemed to have been giving this some thought.

"Can you put some lotion on my back, honey?" she asked when our friends returned, loud enough that everyone would hear.

""I... Hmm, not right now," I said, realizing I should remain on my stomach.

One of the women in the group did it instead. I realized with puzzlement that I wished that one of the guys had volunteered it instead.

Now spying on my wife from behind a rock, it seemed she had relaxed her stance on the exposure part, walking around topless with two of my friends. Even though I felt that she should at least have done this when I was around rather than when she thought she was out of my sight, I also found it strangely thrilling that she had done just that. So rather than trying to put an end to her exposure, I used the notion of inconstancy to justify my continued spying. "Tit for tat," I thought, even though it was admittedly mostly tit at that point.

It sounded like they had resumed their hike, and I dared peeking over the edge. I felt a stir in my cock as I saw her walking away between my two bare chested friends, her ass swaying with confidence. I regularly worked out with Joel and Mark, and now I found myself oddly grateful that they too stayed in shape. It would have been an insolence to my wife's sensuous exposure, had she been framed by a couple of horrid guys. It seemed like Silvia was the one doing most of the talking now, Joel and Mark paying eager attention. They too had sunglasses that covered exactly where they were looking at, but I could tell it wasn't mainly her words they were focusing on.

They soon came to a sudden halt as Silvia stopped. I held my head close to the ground to avoid detection, this time primarily by Joel or Mark who had turned to face her on the road. But I was too intrigued not to look. I couldn't hear what Silvia was saying, but she seemed to be asking them something. She pulled at the hem of her panties, creating an audible snap as she released them. The guys nodded eagerly.

She slowly hooked her thumbs inside her panties. My heart pounded in my chest. What was she doing?

"Are you sure?" she asked, just loud enough for me to hear. My friends nodded even harder.

I stared in disbelief. Would she really...? She hesitated, looking around as if making sure no one would see. I shook my head at her sudden shyness — she had two very keen onlookers right in front of her. But she was apparently not concerned by their presence. On the contrary, she seemed quite flirtatious, giggling as she teasingly pulled down her panties an inch before stopping and pulling them back up again. She did this repeatedly, and I grew increasingly certain that she didn't actually have it in her to follow through. It disappointed me.

She let go of her panties, and it looked as if she was about to start walking again. I told myself that it was probably for the best. Even though I found the thought of her walking around completely naked surprisingly arousing, it was a bit over-the-top.

But just as I conceded that she was doing the right thing by keeping her panties on, she again hooked her thumbs inside them. She nervously scanned her surroundings one last time before she bent at the hips and started to ever so slowly pull them down over her round ass. I gasped softly at the sight. Many times had I watched her take off her panties just like that — it was a move she often did to either arouse or taunt me — but never had it looked so enchanting. I felt privileged to have witnessed it. And yet there was an odd part of me that thought she should have used this opportunity to tease her other audience with her round ass.

That thought quickly left my mind as she straightened her back, and I realized that my friends in front of her were treated to the sight of her naked pussy. I was enchanted by her brazen behavior, and my cock pressed against the confines of my shorts. Somewhere inside me I felt that I should have been jealous, but the primary emotion besides my pulsating arousal was pride — proud that she could be so bold, and proud that she was my wife.

Her panties lingered above her knees until she took a deep breath and made them fall to the ground. She stepped out of them, and without looking back she started to walk. If she had been nervous about stripping down completely it didn't show anymore, her stride confident as she paraded between and past Joel and Mark. They were quick to follow, and the three of them soon disappeared as the path led them behind the rocks.

I found myself momentarily unable to move, paralyzed by the confusing excitement. It was hard to grasp that I had just watched my wife strip down. But her white panties were still lying on the trail below as evidence of what had just transpired. I had no idea what she was up to, but I was consumed by the desire to watch her more.

I stumbled after them, picking up her panties as I passed them. It felt surreal, and I wasn't sure myself anymore why I carried her clothes and underwear with me. I tried pushing away the excitement that cluttered my mind to think over exactly what I was doing. I couldn't keep spying on my naked wife all day. On the other hand I couldn't really just walk up to her and hand over her entire wardrobe either, acting like I was just then catching up? What's the appropriate thing to do when you find your naked wife with two of your friends? Should I pretend that I was angry, even though there were very different emotions brewing inside me?

And should I be angry? Sure, I had made a stupid joke about her going skinny dipping, but even if she somehow had taken that seriously, she was doing so much more; she was walking around naked in broad daylight, flanked by my ogling friends. Wasn't there a sense of deceit to what she was doing? If this was something she did to make me eat my words, surely she was taking it too far. Was she planning on telling me later, rubbing in my face the fact that she'd exposed herself when I wasn't around? Or was she going to keep her exciting secret to herself, hoping my friends wouldn't spill the beans? I convinced myself that it was about time catch up and ask her to put her clothes back on.

But as soon as I turned the corner, the sight of her exposure washed away any plan to put an end to it. How could it be so erotic to watch her naked in the open air? The contrast between her feminine forms and the chiseled men surrounding her accentuated her sensuous curves. And the pride in her stance as the only one naked in the group gave her an aura of seductive glow.

My friends also seemed to enjoy her appearance, and if they were trying hard to hide their gawking, they did a terrible job. They had previously walked mostly on line, with Silvia in the middle, but now they guys roamed around more. Sometimes they found excuses to fall behind, giving them a close-up of the view I had of her round ass swaying with her stride. I could only guess what she must look like when they ran ahead and watched her approach, her tits swaying and her pussy exposed. She kept herself neatly trimmed, and I knew her intimate details were on display for their prying eyes. She did nothing to cover up.

The notion that they were getting a better view of her than mine gave me a hint of honest jealousy. For reasons I couldn't grasp, I had no problem with the fact that she was showing off for them — I was even aroused by it if I were honest with myself — but shouldn't I get at least as good of a view? I didn't expect to get another chance to watch her strolling around naked in the wild anytime soon, and decided I had to make the most of it.

A plan began to crystallize in my mind. We were approaching the swimming spot, but I realized I could shortcut them and make it there before them if I ran through the surrounding forest. That way I could wait for them there, and I would get to enjoy the frontal view as she approached. If I could find a good hiding spot, I could continue to watch her as she swam naked in the lake. And when they eventually headed back, I could backtrack the same way and meet them on the path pretending I came running straight from the cabin. I could pretend I had found her clothes on the way and were worried something had happened. Being a bit out of breath from running back would support my story.

But I had to run quickly now to give myself enough time to find a hiding spot. Not wanting her clothes to slow me down, I hid them behind a big tree where it would be easy to find them when I returned. I took off, realizing the bulge in my shorts posed a bigger problem for running.

I found the perfect hiding spot, with bushes I could squat behind while still giving me a mostly unobstructed view of the trail she would approach on as well as over the entrance point to the lake. On some level I knew I was being ridiculous, spying on my wife for the purpose of seeing her naked, but it was too thrilling to care about such reason. I quickly ducked down in my lair, expecting to see her come walking on the footpath any second.

I waited. One minute, two... By my calculations I should have just made it in time. Five minutes, ten... This was odd. There was no way it should have taken them this long. Could they for some reason have turned back before reaching the swimming spot? That would ruin my plan completely. I couldn't exactly come running after them with her clothes when they were on their way home, pretending I was just then catching up. Maybe I could detour and intersect them before they reached the spot where she had removed her panties instead. But it was doubtful, especially since I had to get the clothes first. At least I had hidden them out of sight from the trail, so she wouldn't see them if she passed that point.

But it was odd that they would have turned around so close to the cooling water. Weren't they as hot as me after hiking all the way here on warm summer's day? I stretched my neck, listening carefully for their voices.

And that's when I heard it. It was just a soft whimper at first. What was that? It grew into distinct moan. That was definitely Silvia. Had she hurt herself? I quickly left my hideout, instinctively running down to the trail to find her.

But I soon stopped in my tracks. It didn't really sound like she was hurt. Quite the opposite in fact. That moan sounded a bit too familiar. I walked slowly to where it was coming from, trying to make sense of it. Surely she couldn't...

The moans seemed to be coming from where the bedrock split into a deep crevice not far ahead. As I drew closer, I could hear male grunts mixing with Silvia's escalating wails.

"Si, si Joel! Fuck me Mark!"

I felt as if my heart stopped. Any hopeful doubt I had about what was going on disappeared. How could she?! And with my friends!

"Yeah, take that," I heard Joel groan. Bastard!

And yet, under the resentful blackness, there was a smoldering turmoil of excitement. Enticed by spying on my naked wife for so long, the thrill was still cluttering my mind. The idea that she could be such a blatant slut was strangely arousing. Of course, no one really wants their wife to be a cheater, but thinking that she had it in her to take on two guys at once was strangely alluring.

But hadn't she made it clear that day on the beach that it was a bad idea? Or was that just if I was one of the men? Was it somehow OK in her mind if she did it behind my back instead? And with my friends none the less! Their betrayal was as big as hers. The blackness grew again.

I had to see it. I wasn't sure myself to what extent I needed it for proof, and how much it was my dirty mind talking, but I needed to watch her being fucked by them before breaking it up. I couldn't hear her anymore, merely male grunts coming from the crevice. I pictured her having her mouth too full to speak. Part of me dreaded it, another part was desperate to see it.

The grunts grew louder, and I started to worry that they might all finish before I caught them. I hurried as fast as I could without being too noisy. My foot slipped on a rock, making it tumble away. I cursed myself silently, but assumed they were too busy screwing to notice. Reaching the crevice, I sneaked ever so slowly to make sure I would capture the scene before breaking it up. My heart pounded in my chest as I tilted my head to look around the corner, expecting to find my friends fucking my wife.

"Buh!"

Silvia jumped me just as I peeked inside. My heart missed a beat. The surprise knocked the breath out of me, leaving me too startled to speak. Behind her I could see Joel and Mark faking horny grunts. As they saw my dumbfounded appearance, the three of them broke out in a gaudy laugh that echoed over the landscape.

This was a very different deceit than I had expected; they weren't even touching. I felt an intense relief. And yet, somewhere inside me was a deranged sense of disappointment — a subliminal deviance that craved to see my wife as a wanton slut.

"You are nowhere near as good of a ninja as you might think," Silvia mocked. Her voice was sharp with sarcasm, but she also greeted me with a kiss. Even I my confused state I was sure I sensed a warm hunger in her lips.

"What are you doing, sneaking around like that?" she continued.

"Uhm, well..." I began, thinking quickly to come up with an excuse. I couldn't just bluntly admit that spying on her was about the most erotic thing I had ever experienced. "I was working on a section for our script where the protagonist goes on a stake-out. I thought I could come up with some inspirational ideas this way."

It was a pretty good lie, all things considered. I looked to my friends for support, hoping they might help me save face. They nodded cautiously. Silvia reacted with a single ambiguous chuckle.

"So are you inspired then?" she asked with a knowing grin.

"Well, I'm mainly sweaty — it's really warm today," I said — an obvious diversion.

Silvia looked at me with a crooked grin. "OK, I guess we should go for a swim then."

She removed her sandals, and carrying them with her she took off jogging towards the lake. It was only then that I re-registered that she was still naked. She might not have had sex with my friends, but she had stripped down and walked around unabashedly exposed, allowing them to see her in all her glory. And yet I was the one who had to answer for myself.

But watching her swaying body as she ran was hypnotizing, vanishing any sense of grudge inside me. My friends stared too. We exchange some sheepish glances before shrugging our shoulders. Acting on instinct, we all chased after her. I couldn't tell how much it was the fact that she was barefooted that slowed her down, and how much she was deliberately slow, but we soon caught up with her. We ran behind her towards the lake, like three enchanted devotees.

Approaching the lake, we ran past her and dove in. She waded in, like an enchanting water nymph. As always, she carried herself with certain elegance, confidently acting like there was nothing odd about the fact that a woman might go for a swim as the only one naked. We watched her in silence, taking in every captivating inch of her body before the water covered her.

As it did, it seemed to break the spell she had us under, and the mood drifted back to normal. Joel and Mark engaged in a race back and forth to a nearby islet, leaving me alone with my wife.

"So," she began, "how did you like my little prank? I think your friends were quite good actors."

"Oh, I didn't really believe you were..."

"What? Having sex with your friends?"

"Yeah, I know you'd never do that."

"Probably not," she said with a chuckle. "So is that's why you decided to sneak up on us, rather than quickly breaking up the party?"

I didn't reply, sensing that anything I said could incriminate me. The astute tone in her voice made me again realize that I was the one in a defensive position. Sure, I had spied on her, but wasn't walking around naked — right in front of my friends, none the less — more outrageous? Even if she was trying to prove some point, she was taking it pretty damn far. And yet I couldn't bring myself to hold her accountable for it.

It soon dawned on me why. With a knowing smile, she turned and swam to the shore and got out of the water to let the sun dry off her naked body. I felt the excitement grow inside me again. But the cooling water kept me levelheaded enough to untangle my own instincts. Whether I liked it or not, I desired her exposure. And the fact that she was exposing herself not just to me, but also to my friends made it even more captivating. Blaming her for it could bring an end to her brazen behavior. I dared not risk it.

Her pleased smirk indicated that she was aware of her advantage. She knew her nakedness was spellbinding us all. I loved her brash behavior, but the lack of power disturbed me. I stared at her as she put her sandals back on.

She spoke without looking up. "I was kind of expecting you to bring my clothes with you. I guess you didn't want me to put them on then?"

She was taunting me again. But her comment also made me realize that perhaps I had some power after all. Her exposure wasn't just hers to control.

My friends returned from their race. Somewhat surprisingly, Mark won even though Joel was the more athletic one. They jabbed loudly, Joel half-seriously accusing Mark of cheating. They silenced however as they spotted Silvia on display by the lake shore. She did nothing to hide of course, and I was sure I saw her pushing her chest out to invite their gaze.

"It's about time to head back," she said, and as she stood and began strolling back to the trail, we all exited the water as the devoted followers we were.

We lingered briefly by the water side before catching up with her. Joel tapped me.

"Hey man, sorry we went along with her plan," he said. "You now, with the prank and... No hard feelings I hope?"

Joel's eyes traced Silvia's steps. "Yeah, she's a hard woman to say no to."

I smirked, knowing they had no saying in this game. They were just pawns.

"So I take it you didn't have any objections when she decided to dress... shall we say informally?"

They chuckled nervously.

"Well, you'd be pleased to know that I think we'll get to enjoy it a bit longer," I continued.

They gave me a quizzical look, but were distracted when Silvia called out to us over her shoulder.

"So are you coming?"

Joel immediately rushed after her, and Mark patted my back.

"Thank you."

"What for?" I asked, even though I had a good idea what he was grateful for.

"Just thank you," he reiterated and hurried to catch up with Silvia.

And so the four of us strolled back towards the cabin — a naked woman with three mesmerized men behind her. The frequency of my heartbeats increased when we passed the tree where I had left her clothes, pleased to see that I had hid them well. She didn't know it yet, but it was no longer her decision to remain naked.

She stopped when we reached the spot where she had peeled off her panties and left them on the path. She gave me a quizzical expression.

"So, you didn't happen to see my panties here?"

"Uhm..." I began, realizing I hadn't decided if I was going to pretend I hadn't seen her clothes on the path, or pretend I had just left them there. "No. I mean yes. But I didn't take them with me. Maybe the wind caught them."

Damn I was poor liar.

"It's not very windy today," she said matter-of-factly.

"Maybe an animal then?" I suggested.

"The panty-steeling squirrel?" she said sarcastically. "Are they common here?"

Joel and Mark remained quiet, wise to not get dragged in. I sensed that my bluff had been called, and prepared myself to sheepishly go fetch her clothes. But she surprised me by spinning around and continued walking.

She shrugged her shoulders. "It's possible, I guess."

I sensed she'd let me off the hook easy. Maybe too easy. But I relished her exposure while it lasted, feeling the excitement growing. When we soon thereafter reached the point where she had hung her bra, she halted again.

"Seems like my bra is gone too," she said. "Hope the squirrel that untied it appreciates that it was pretty damn expensive."

I again feared she would confront me and make me run for her clothes. She looked at me with that piercing gaze that always seemed like she was staring straight into my soul, often deeper than I could see myself. I was about to budge when she once more surprised me by not calling my bluff. Instead she just continued towards the cabin.

And so we strolled, a naked woman with three men orbiting around her. My mind became decreasingly concerned with why she wasn't exposing my obvious lie. Whatever her reasons were, I was going to enjoy every moment of her continued nakedness. I couldn't get past how confident her posture was, expressing a perception that of course a beautiful woman should be naked when she goes for a walk with her husband and his friends. Showing off seemed so natural to her now.

And she was showing off. Her swaying motion wasn't that of a woman eager to find her clothes. Instead she moved slowly. I moved past her, aiming to now take in the full view of her exposure while it lasted. My eyes traveled over her body as she approached, her appearance glowing with an aura of eroticism. Every step she took felt like a choreographed display, her slender legs accentuated by the slight lift of her sandals.

As my eyes traveled up her legs, they were drawn to her most intimate details. And there it was, the telltale signs of why she really was doing this. The sun had long since dried her body after the swim, but between her legs I saw a glistening wetness. She wasn't shamelessly exposing herself to me and my friends to prove some point, or to show that she was brave enough to not budge; she was doing it because it turned her on. It was as simple as that. The realization made my own excitement rise.

I knew she could tell where my eyes went, but it didn't dissuade her confident smile. Instead she seemed to increase the swagger in her steps. She was walking next to Joel, chatting about something my mind was too distracted from to register. As they passed me, she linked arms with him. I knew her Italian culture made her much more relaxed about physical contact when interacting, and I usually didn't think much about it. But she wasn't usually naked.

Mark had been enjoying the rear view, and she called back to him.

"Hey, Mark! Joel says you cheated in the race before."

"Yeah right!" he replied and ran up to them, defending the validity of his victory

She linked arms with him on her other side. It meant nothing, I told myself. But however innocent, it meant she had moved on to touching. And didn't she purposefully lean in to one or the other so that their arms would brush against her swaying breasts? My excitement acted against my better judgment, and I felt my cock press against the confines of my shorts. As if making sure she had correctly predicted my reaction, she turned her head and looked me up and down. She sported a sly grin before turning her focus back to the men she was wedged between.

"So you're saying that Joel is just a sore loser then?" she asked, playfully adding fuel to the bickering between them.

But as we drew close to the cabin I realized that this could be the end of the excitement. Silvia would probably want to leave straight away to get to the designated winery we had planned for the evening.

"You know, honey," I said, looking at my watch. "It's getting pretty late. Why don't we have our own wine tasting here instead?"

"Yeah, we picked up some really nice bottles on the way," Mark said.

"I have one I'd love for you to taste," Joel chimed in.

She studied me silently for a moment. "OK, I suppose we could."

"Great!" I said, trying to wipe the smile off my face.

My friends too were pleased we could prolong her brazen display, and when we reached the cabin we presented her with a recliner where we told her to enjoy the last sunlight while it lasted. It didn't take much persuading. I lingered while Joel and Mark disappeared inside the cabin to fetch the wine. I knelt beside her and kissed her lips.

"You look very beautiful, honey," I told her.

She smirked. "Oh, you prefer this look on me, do you?"

I nodded.

"So you like exposing me, letting your friends see me naked?" she taunted, and tipped her glasses to emphasize her gaze as she looked at my crotch. "It sure looks like part of you is."

I sneered and let my hand travel up her leg as I leaned into kiss her again. "It seems to me you enjoy the attention too."

She stopped my hand just before I reached her wetness, and wiggled her finger at me. "Tss, tss, tss... What exactly are you trying to pull off, honey? Hiding my clothes, persuading me to drink wine with your friends, and now trying to get me worked up... Are you hoping I will let your friends give me some hands-on attention? Didn't we talk about how that would be a bad idea?"

Thinking back to that day on the beach, I recalled it as mostly her talking. I felt a rush of excitement, but still agreed. "Of course."

"Why don't you fetch me some wine instead," she said. "Get me something nice."

I noted that her Italian accent had become increasingly pronounced. I recognized this as something that tended to happen when she was angry, drunk or excited. She didn't seem angry, and she hadn't yet had any wine.

I dashed inside, meeting my friends in the door. I picked a bottle quickly, thinking it was best to not let her wait. When I got back out, I found Joel and Mark on either side of her recliner, serving her wine. I added my own selection to the mix. She was soaking up the attention, three men trying to impress her. It was far from a proper wine tasting, but the decadence was captivating. She seemed to really enjoy herself, and I was surprised when she suddenly wanted to put an end to it.

"OK, boys, I think it's time we get going. Is my bag inside, honey?"

"Yes, it's in my room."

The silence that followed echoed with disappointment. The three of us watched as she stood and walked inside the cabin, presumably to get dressed. We glanced sheepishly among ourselves. I shrugged my shoulders. It was fun while it lasted.

"Honey, can you come here for a minute?" she soon yelled from inside.

I found her with her arms crossed over her chest and a rather stern look on her face. I looked at her quizzically. "Yes?"

"Don't you think this has gone far enough?"

"What?" I said, not catching her drift.

"I guess hiding my clothes was a bit original the first time. But again? Really?"

I looked at her in confusion.

She sighed. "Where's my bag?"

"Your bag?"

"Yes. The one with all my clothes in it."

"Isn't it in my room?"

She shook her head. "Are you really going to keep playing this game?"

"I put it in here earlier today," I said and walked into my room, pointing to the spot where I had left it. "Before you walked off with Joel and Mark."

She stared at me, reading in my expression.

"Well, it isn't here now," she said, less accusing this time. "Are you sure you didn't put it somewhere else?"

"Yeah, very sure."

"Then someone has taken it. Could someone have broken in while we were gone?"

"I doubt it," I said. "It's not like a lot of people come here. And why would someone just take your bag and leave everything else?"

She stood quiet for a moment. "So Joel or Mark then?"

"I don't know. Doesn't seem like something either of them would do."

It didn't. I would never have considered the possibility that one of my friends would hide my wife's clothes. But then again, I had never expected that she would strip down and walk around naked with them. This day could hold further surprises.

"But I guess it's possible," I added. "They were alone in the cabin quite some time when they were picking out wine for you. Maybe they didn't want us to leave."

"And do you want us to leave?" she asked.

"I guess we can't now. Do you want me to ask them if they have it? I'm sure they'd give it up if I told them."

She studied me in silence before shaking her head. "No, I'll do it myself. Do you have a blanket?"

I handed her one from the bed, thinking she would cover herself with it. But instead she just held it under her arm as she paraded outside again. I followed her, thinking that it was pretty damn cheeky if one of my friends had stolen her clothes, but I was rather thankful if they had. I felt my cock hardening again, spurred by the prospect that she would continue to show off for them.

Joel and Mark had just lit a fire, something we had done most of the nights — not for the heat, but for the light. When they saw my still naked wife approaching, they themselves lit up. They sat down on the patio sofa by the fireplace, watching her swaying body as she approached.

She stopped in front of them, the blanked under one arm and the other hand confidently on her hip. Their eyes wandered over her body. I partly expected her to fire off at them for hiding her things, but she didn't seem angry. She hesitated — not a common trait for her. Maybe it was the fact that she was naked that humbled her. I sat down in a chair opposite to my friends to see what she would do.

"What's up, Silvia?" Joel asked.

She hesitated another moment before dumping the blanked on the ground. I couldn't quite understand why she had brought it if she wasn't going to cover up anyway. I thought that maybe she wanted the option in case she got uncomfortable. But it seemed like she was going to continue her flaunting. Sitting down between them, she turned to Joel.

"You don't happen to know where my bag is, do you?"

He shook his head. "No. Is it missing?"

She studied his reaction in silence before scooting over to Mark. She moved in close and spoke softly into his ear. "What about you, Mark — have you taken my bag?"

He swallowed. "Sorry, Silvia. I haven't seen it."

She lingered by his side for a moment before shifting back to Joel. She put her arm around him, letting her hand wander over his back and shoulders. "Are you sure you don't have it?"

His eyes were drawn down between her parted legs. "Uhu," was all he could mutter. His expression showed lust, but not guilt.

She moved back to Mark, this time placing her hand on his thigh. "You would tell me if you had it, right?"

He nodded softly, looking to me for a moment before returning his gaze to the hand that moved dangerously close to the massive bulge in his shorts. When he didn't give her any more information, she shifted back to Joel. She put her hand on his torso.

"Are you the cheeky one who stole all my clothes?" she asked, and let her hand wander downwards. He gasped as her fingers brushed against the erection that was pressing against his shorts. She grinned. "Oops."

She stood up, and for a moment I got worried she would end whatever it was that she was doing. But as she stepped over to Mark and began slowly swaying her ass before him, I knew she had more in store for us. My erection pressed hard against the confines of my shorts.

"You've been looking at it all day," she said as she glanced down at Mark over her shoulder. "I bet you want to touch it too."

He nodded, but didn't make a move. She bent slightly at her hips as she continued to taunt his mesmerized gaze. "All you have to do is admit that you took my bag."

He looked confused. "I... I don't..."

"No? OK, then your friend gets a chance instead," she said and punished his lack of compliance by shifting over to Mark. She stood between his parted legs. "Seems like it's your lucky day."

She swayed her ass in front of him, and he wasn't slow to accept the invite. His hands moved up her thighs and onto her ass. She bit her bottom lip, looking at me while my friend's hands grew increasingly greedy. Still gyrating her hips, she bent her knees and lowered herself into his lap. He held on to her hips, supporting her as she massaged his erection with her ass. She leaned back against him, speaking softly into his ear.

"You've been staring at these too," she said, fondling her breasts.

He nodded, and his hands traveled up her body. But she grabbed them just before reaching their targets.

"Uh-uh, you have to give my bag back first."

He grunted with disappointment. She gave him a few seconds opportunity to confess before she stood and moved over to Mark instead. She sat down in his lap, back against him and her legs spread over his. She arched her back, pushing her chest out.

"Go on," she said.

Mark didn't hesitate, his hands traveling up her body to her inviting breasts. They both moaned softly as he reached them. She locked eyes with me as he greedily massaged her tits, a challenging look on her face. She broke out in a wide grin as her gaze dropped to my bulging erection. Her own excitement was also unmistakable, glistening wetness covering her pussy as she spread it open over Mark's lap. Moving her hand behind her, she reached for his cock.

"I bet you want to take it out," she said. He merely grunted as a response. "But..." she continued, removing her hand. "You have to admit you took my bag first."

He knew the deal by now, groaning in defeat as he removed his hands from her breasts. She moved over to Joel instead, and he looked expectantly at her as he stood before him. She bent at the hips, giving me a great view of her round ass as she reached for the knot of his shorts.

"That looks painful," she said as she slowly pulled the knot open. "Let me help you with that."

And without hesitation, she reached inside his shorts and pulled his hard cock out. Moving out of the way she made sure I had a good view as she wrapped her hand around the thick shaft. I stared with my mouth open, barely able to take in that my wife was stroking my friend's cock. She grinned at my mesmerized expression a moment before turning her attention back to Joel. She straddled him, and as his hands moved over her body, she began making out with him. They moaned into each other's mouths, and she began grinding her pussy against his erection. I could hear the slippery wet sound as she slid back and forth against it.

She panted heavily as she backed away from his mouth. "Do... you have... my bag?"

I didn't understand the logic of her game, but it did seem like she had him in a position to admit to pretty much anything at that point. Yet, he merely groaned with frustration and helped her to her feet. She shifted over to a very enthusiastic Mark. Without a word, she undid the knot of his trunks to release his cock. He raised his hips so she could pull them all the way off. She knelt beside him on the sofa, kissing him while wrapping her hand around his cock. It looked massive in her delicate hand.

Her hand grew increasingly eager, pumping away over his shaft. It seemed like she was going to make him cum, but she stopped herself. With her back against him, she straddled his lap. Looking into my eyes, she gyrated her ass against his erection. Tilting her head backwards and placing one arm up around her neck, she gave his mouth access to hers. As their tongues twirled, Mark's hands roamed over her body.

I panted with anticipation as she raised herself up, reaching for his cock between her legs. As she lowered herself back down, she pointed it forward so that her lower lips pressed against the upside of his shaft. She moved her pussy back and forth, her wet folds dancing over his protruding erection. I stared in a state of trance, my friend's cock now ever so close to slide inside my wife's open pussy. She held on to it, rubbing its swollen head against her clit. She moaned out loud. As she raised herself up again, pointing the tip against her gaping pussy, I was sure she was going to take the final step.

But she paused, looking at me with a devious grin. Oblivious to myself, I had been rubbing my erection through my trunks. Mark threw his head back in defeat as she suddenly let go of his cock. She stood and paraded over to me, her hips swaying confidently. She straddled my lap.

"Are you enjoying yourself, honey?" she asked, her voice oozing with seduction. I couldn't master any reaction.

"Were you getting your hopes up?" she continued, whispering in my ear. "Remember what we talked about? It's not a good idea to let one of your friends fuck your wife."

I was sure that my friends would have been as disappointed as me if they had heard her words. Could she really be such a raging tease and call it off just like that?

"Oh, look at those puppy eyes," she taunted, rubbing my cheek with her fingers.

But as she kissed me, I felt the unmistakable hunger in her lips. She was depriving herself as much as the rest of us. And as she kissed her way down my neck and continued down my torso, I thought that this was a very confusing way of putting a stop to her mischief. She dropped to her knees and kissed her way towards my cock.

"I don't want you to hurt yourself, honey," she said as she pulled down my trunks to release my throbbing erection. Bowing down, she planted a tender kiss on its head before returning up to whisper in my ear.

"Yes, it's a very bad idea to share me with one of your friends. But with two friends... that's a completely different deal."

With that, she backed away from me. Picking up the blanket she had dropped to the ground, she threw it open over the grass and proceeded to kneel in the middle of it. She faced me with a sly grin on her face, and I stared with gaping mouth as she kept us in suspense.

Slowly, she turned her head, looking at Joel over her shoulder. She pointed at him and curved her finger to call him in. He didn't hesitate, quickly stumbling to his feet and dropping his shorts. As he approached, she motioned for him to stand by her side, his rock-hard cock pointing at her face. Her focus traveled from his cock, up to his face, and then back to me. As her eyes returned to his cock, her hand traveled up his leg. He grunted as she wrapped her hand around his erection.

She stroked him softly, her hungry eyes darting between me and the erection before her face. Her lips parted as she leaned in, and ever so lightly she flicked her tongue over the tip, making Joel gasp. She looked at me with a pleased grin before leaning in again, this time running her tongue all the way from the base of his cock up over its head. Her lips widened, and she held Joel's cock pointed at her open mouth a moment before slowly inserting it. She moaned as her lips closed around it, and I realized that I did too. She began bobbing her head back and forth, making Joel throw his head back in pleasure.

She soon stopped however, turning her head over the other shoulder and waving Mark in. She was too inflamed with lust to give him a gradual welcome, and she immediately attacked his cock with her hungry mouth. Her sinful eyes glanced tauntingly at me as she sucked him. One hand on each cock, she pumped her fist over their shafts, her eager mouth moving between them. She moaned in heat. I stroked myself, enthralled by her slutty display.

As she stopped, saliva still connected her mouth to the man last in her mouth. She looked up at the guys, stroking their glistening cocks, before turning her wanton gaze to me.

"You can join, or watch, or both," she panted, saliva dripping from her lips. "But I'm going to fuck your friends now."

With that she lay down on her back. Her legs parted towards Mark, and he didn't miss a beat. She locked eyes with me as he climbed on top of her, and her mouth gaped wide in a muted shriek as he guided his cock inside her. I had seen this passionate expression on her face countless times, but never in response to another man entering her pussy.

Mark started slow, but soon built up the pace. She spread her legs wide for deeper access, her feet still in delicate sandals as they pointed towards the sky. She bucked her hips up, meeting each thrust. I could tell that it wouldn't be long before she climaxed.

But she stopped Mark, pushing him off her.

"I want both," she panted and turned to Joel. "Your turn."

He had been stroking his cock as he watched, and was more than ready to take over as Mark backed away. He slid inside her with one steady push. He soon shifted to a kneeling position, lifting her hips up as he continued to thrust into her, her upper back resting on the ground. I couldn't tell if this was a favorite position of his, or if he was being a god pal by not obstructing the sight of her body as he fucked her. Mark too must have found the sight of her swaying breast alluring, and kneeling by her side, he began groping her. She returned the favor by stroking his cock.

The notion that it was wrong to watch my wife get fucked by other men didn't even enter my mind. The expression of ecstatic pleasure on her face sent thrills of excitement through my own body. I found myself grunting at the sight. Her wailing escalated with each thrust. I could tell that she was spiraling up towards a climactic release. She turned to me.

"I'm going to come! Oh, honey...! Si, Si! I'm... I'm..!"

She ruptured into an ear-shattering cry, her body shaking in ecstasy as Joel drove her through her climax. He was obviously struggling to hold back, but he too must have wanted to prolong this sinful occasion. He fucked her gently as she came down. She purred with erotic delight.

Looking into her passionate eyes, it was clear that this was not a woman who had had enough. As soon as she regained control of her body, she pulled Mark to the ground. She straddled him, easing herself onto his cock. As she began riding him, Joel found his place next to them, feeding his cock into her hungry mouth.

When Mark's groan indicated that he was getting close, she dismounted from him. She knelt on all fours, holding her ass high. The invite wasn't lost on Joel, who knelt behind her, inserting his cock with a steady thrust. She squealed with delight as he started slamming into her, making her breast sway beneath her.

She looked at me, and then at Mark, who was stroking his cock beside her.

"Next," she panted.

My friends swapped, and as Mark began fucking her, Joel knelt before her. She didn't hesitate, gaping wide as an invitation for his cock. She rocked between them, filled at both ends. Her muffled moans intensified, and it wasn't long before she erupted into another orgasm.

The guys barely let her recover before Joel took over, grabbing onto her hips as he began slamming into her. Turning to me, she looked like she was about to say something, but overwhelmed with erotic pleasure she had lost all words. She turned her mouth to Mark's glistening cock instead. The taste of her own excitement seemed to push her further into wanton ecstasy.

The sun had settled, but the fire had caught momentum, casting sinful shadows as my friends continued to fuck my wife. Her erotic vigor matched her two lovers' as they kept trading places. It was often hard to tell where one orgasm ended, and another one began. I was constantly tempted to join in, especially when Silvia's eyes stared hungrily at my erection. But the court side view of my wife taking on two guys was the most erotic thing I'd ever seen. These were images I wanted a clear as possible memory of.

But all good things must end. The guys eventually needed their release. After being teased by Silvia's naked body all afternoon, it was actually rather impressive that they had lasted as long as they did. She knelt on her blanket, motioning for the men to stand.

"Go on, guys," she said, her sinful eyes looking up at them. "Let's make this perfect. Aim for my face."

I gasped when she said it. It wasn't uncommon for her to grant me that pleasure, often when she was particularly satisfied with the pleasure I had given her. She stared at me, making me feel that this was a reward for me rather than for the two men who had provided for her this evening. As the guys approached her from both sides, she bit her bottom lips and winked at me. They pumped at their cocks, directing them at her welcoming face.

"Oh!" she yelped as the first strand landed across her lips. She broke out in a wide grin, gasping at every splash against her face. She kept her taunting eyes fixed upon me as long as she could. My friends seemed to aim mainly for her mouth, but they lost control during their release, and several strands landed close to her eyes. She closed them, but her grin stayed wide open, cum dripping from her lips.

As their flow eventually subsided, she opened her eyes again. By that time, I was already on my way over to her. She giggled as she saw me. Falling to her back, she spread her legs wide. I was inside her within the blink of an eye. Steadying myself on my straightened arms, I forcefully thrust into her, looking down on her cum-covered face. Multiple white strands contrasted against her olive skin. Her taunting grin turned into an expression of erotic pleasure. Through sheer willpower, I held on long enough to take her through yet another powerful climax.

She wanted it perfect, and I pulled out, shooting my offering onto her already covered face and tits. High on excitement, she giggled erratically as I showered her with strand after strand. My flow seemed to never end.

I helped her sit up as soon as I regained the power over my own body. Covered with cum from her three admirers, it would have been pushing it to describe her as graceful, but somehow she still managed to hold herself with a certain class. She was glowing with erotic pride. Amazed, we stared at her.

"Well, this was better than wine tasting," she said, seductively licking her glistening lips as she winked at me.

We chuckled, but no one found any words.

"All right," she said eventually. "I think I might need a shower."

We helped her to her feet.

"Shall I go with you?" I offered.

"Nah. I think I might need a moment."

She headed for the cabin. Though her knees were obviously week, her ass still swayed with confidence. We stared in awe.

After a moment awkward silence, I decided to pour us some wine.

"So, that happened," I said, handing a glass to each of my friends.

They laughed. "Yeah, I guess it did!"

There were no suiting words to say among friends after sharing one of their wives, and we drank our wine mostly in silence.

"I better go check that she's OK," I said eventually.

Inside, I found her out of the shower, wrapped in a towel and already reapplying make-up.

"Hey, where did you find that?" I asked, pointing at her make-up kit.

"In my bag," she said with a smirk.

"Aha. The one that you claimed was stolen?"

"Yeah, seems like I found it after all," she said, pointing at it next to the bed. "Oops."

"Hmm..." I grunted. "Did you just conspire to get yourself...?"

She looked at me challenging. "Get myself what?"

"To get yourself fucked by two of my friends... You slut!"

She raised her eyebrows and tilted her head, her confident grin never leaving her face. "Is that so?"

I took her in my arms. "You..." I began, and continued while placing kisses on her cheeks. "You devious... Sexy... Adorable... Slut!"

She unwrapped the towel from her body, and I felt my cock grow hard again against her naked skin.

She whispered in my ear. "And you like it, don't you? You like that your wife can be a little slut."

"Yes!" I admitted, not really in a position to argue. "And you know what? I know you like it to."

She smirked. "Maybe."

She pushed me back against the bed and began kissing her way down my body. By the time she reached my cock, I was already fully erect. I gasped as she engulfed me.

I soon heard my friends chuckling, standing in the door.

"We just wanted to check that everything was fine," Joel said. "And it sure seems like it is!"

Silvia didn't turn around, her head continuing to bob in my lap. She was facing away from the door, and I was sure that I saw her arching her back ever so slightly, emphasizing the curve of her alluring ass.

"Yeah, and it turns out Silvia's bag has miraculously reappeared again," I said with a smirk. "Can one of you lock it away in your room? We're staying the weekend, and she's not getting her clothes back until we leave."

Silvia's eyes flew wide open, but continued her oral servitude. But as Mark picked up her bag, she suddenly stopped him.

"Wait!"

I was surprised that she would have any objections, but figured that maybe I was pushing it. But rather than taking back her bag, she made Mark open it for her as she knelt on the floor. She retrieved something before sending Mark off to lock up her bag.

"This might come in handy," she said, placing a jar of lubricant on the bed next to me.

As she returned her mouth to my cock, she reached back with one hand and pulled her cheeks apart, giving my friends a suggestive invite. Soon thereafter, we were on the bed, Silvia impaled with a cock in each of her welcoming openings.

She was a greedy slut, and I loved her for it.
