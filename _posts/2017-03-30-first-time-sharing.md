title: First Time Sharing
---
My wife Christina and I are a typical but not-so-typical Southern California couple. We are both blond-haired and blue-eyed, both slim, both in our early 30s and not-so-typically very happy. My name is Jared.

We both enjoy life and try to live it as fully as is possible. We are both gainfully employed, both laugh a lot and have many, many close friends. One of those friends is named Jonathon, or Jon for short.

Jon and I had met at the University of Southern California, USC that is, and had become grand friends. Jon was the person who introduced me to Christina and I immediately knew that she was "the one." 

We were an odd, but happy trio. Both Christina and I are white and had never competed in any type of sport. Jon is black and was a tremendous track-and-field athlete at USC.

Not long after finishing college, Christina and I of course became married, and of course Jon was my best-man. Throughout the following years, our marriage flourished, but Jon never found the happiness we two had found. There was a very long string of stunning beauties of all shapes and colors that Jon had dated, but he never was able, or maybe wanting or willing, to duplicate our happiness.

No matter. Both Christina and I deeply loved Jon. 

One evening Christina and I had Jon over for a grand multi-course dinner and the wine and words flowed and flowed. We all helped with the clean up, then adjourned to the large den. Christina and I both loved to entertain, so we'd spent a bit of money on the living space.

There was a very large, semicircular over-stuffed sofa to one side of the room, and we all three sat down, Jon in the center, me to his right and Christina to his left.

Jon said, "I've brought a surprise for us all."

He presented a very professionally rolled brown-cigarette-paper joint.

"Tada." he said. "I now have a medical-marijuana prescription and thought I'd share this first joint with my two very best friends. I've been told to be careful because this specific strain is called 'Popeye' and is reputed to be very strong and may also have certain desired or undesired side-effects."

Jon carefully lit up the brown joint and took a deep hit. He then passed it to Christina who also took one down. I was last and took the final hit of 'Popeye.'

This stuff had a punch, a real punch.

I hadn't smoked weed for several years and had certainly never smoked anything even close to the strength of 'Popeye.'

All three of us were soon incredibly "baked." We just sat there and grinned and snickered, no one really saying anything. That is until...

... there was the distinct sound of a very petite, very feminine, female bit of flatulence. All three of us heard a sound that went something like this, "Boike." Almost like a small bubble breaking the surface of bath-water.

No one acknowledged what was presumably Christina's tiny fart.

Then, Jon began to laugh.

Jon did his best to hold it in, but he began to shake and shake with internalized laughter. This of course got me started and I too began to shake.

The two us us shook and shook until neither of us could contain it any longer and we both burst out into loud, hard laughter.

Christina was truly embarrassed, even getting a little angry when there it went again, "Boike, boike." Two more tiny little farts.

Jon and I were power-laughing, so Christina had no choice but to join in. There we were, three financially successful friends in our mid-30s laughing away at a woman's intestinal gas.

The laughter went on and on, often punctuated by yet another "Boike."

You probably don't even remember the last time you had such a weed induced period of deep-bottom-belly-laughter, and though painful, it was truly wonderful.

We were all rocking back-and-forth, laughing away and hugging each other's shoulders. Lots of love, lots of contact. Then something odd happened, at least to me.

One of 'Popeye's' side-effects hit me.

I felt a sense of arousal building inside of me. That feeling moved from my core and down into my groin. It was almost a feeling of heat. My laughter slowed and my breathing got heavy. Were the other two feeling this? Had 'Popeye' also affected them?

My left hand was on Jon's right leg and Christina's right hand was on his left leg.

I looked down and could see Jon's cock growing inside of the left leg of his loose slacks, very near my wife's hand. His cock lengthened and lengthened, and was soon touching Christina's hand.

She didn't act offended or even surprised. She simply began to massage the head of that long cock through the pants. 'Popeye's' side-effects had them too.

No one said a word. I watched as she worked that cock-head, occasionally sliding up the length of the shaft. Was 'Popeye' about to destroy the best friendship of my life, about to destroy my marriage?

Jon's head was back as my wife gave him pleasure. Rather than become angry or jealous, I moved in for a closer look. I got within a foot of their contact and watched her hand circle the head of that cock. 

Without knowing why, I reached out with my right hand and cupped Jon's balls through his pants. Both she and I slowly gave Jon a slow, sensual massage.

Jon was moaning and sighing with pleasure when he suddenly sat up. He shook his head from side to side and said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are we doing? I love you both very much, but this is crazy. Goddamn 'Popeye' crazy-ass weed."

Christina and I were still very aroused, so we continued massaging Jon's cock and balls. Jon said, "Wait, wait, wait. You sure you two want to go on with this? I love you both, but this could really fuck things up."

Christina's eyes met mine and we simultaneously smiled in agreement. I nodded at her and she said, "Jon, you're right, we both do love you. Nothing could hurt this friendship. Just relax and let us take care of you."

He answered, "You sure? You sure? Because if you are, help me out of these goddamn pants, my cock is killing me all bent over like that." We all three laughed at that statement.

I said, "Christina, unzip his pants and pull his cock out."

Christina reached over, pushed up Jon's shirt and unbuckled his belt, then unzipped his pants. His cock was still trapped in his pants leg, so I said, "Jon, scooch up and let us help you out of these pants."

Jon moved upwards, then Christina and I helped each other remove Jon's pants. As we lowered his pants, his hard cock sprang free and slapped against his belly. Jon was in stocking-feet, so we worked his pants down around his ankles, then pulled them free. 

I got lower, then pushed Jon's knees apart and directed Christina to join me on the floor between Jon's open legs.

There it was, Jon's thick, black uncut cock standing straight up. His balls hung low and for the most part, he was cleanly shaven.

Christina went back to jacking his cock and I went back to massaging his balls. Christina said, "Jared, get up here and watch this." With her slender hands, she jacked and squeezed Jon's cock. I could see his foreskin slip back and forth over his cock-head. She said, "Pretty hot eh?"

She went on, "Now watch me." She pulled down on his cock and gripped him tightly. Jon's cock-head was prominent and filled with blood from the way she held him. She looked into my eyes and began to lick that beautiful cock-head. Around and around she used her tongue. Licking, stroking, licking, stroking, me massaging his balls the whole time.

Jon was removing his shirt when he said, "This isn't fair, you two get naked too."

Christina and I stood up, then supported one another as we stripped off our clothes. As we did so, Jon re-lit the joint and took a deep hit. He said, "This is amazing, do whatever you want to do."

Christina and I got back down on the floor and she went back to stroking that cock. I got very close and watched her squeeze the base of the cock, then lick the head. She switched hands, then brought one hand to the back of my head and pulled me nearer to the action. I bet I was only three inches from Jon's cock. Christina said, "Watch me, watch me."

She really got into it, running her tongue up and down the shaft, teasing Jon by licking that sensitive area in the back of the cock-head. She then brought her open mouth to the head of Jon's cock as she used her fist to jack him. 

Her mouth was open far enough for me to see how much she was using her tongue on the head of Jon's cock. Fuck it was hot! I was slowly jacking my own cock as I watched my wife use my best friend's cock.

Jon was leaning back and really enjoying what my wife was doing to him. Jon's black cock was shiny with my wife's saliva. She looked at me and said, "You like this? You want some?"

"Yeah, yeah." I said. Christina offered Jon's cock to me by tilting it in my direction. 

I opened my mouth and sucked my first cock. Christina continued to hold the shaft, slowly jack it up and down. She said, "That's good, that's good. Use your tongue, keep your mouth wet."

That fucking 'Popeye' had done me in. I was waaaaay into this. Fuck I loved that black cock in my mouth. Fuck I loved my wife teaching me what to do.

Jon must have not been aware that it was my mouth on his cock because he looked down and laughingly said, "Oh my God, we are all going straight to Hell." We all giggled a little and things slowed down for a bit.

Jon said, "Is the bedroom OK? We're this far, let's use a little more 'Popeye' and see where this goes."

Christina and I joined Jon back on the couch and we passed the joint back and forth. Christina skipped into the kitchen and brought back an ice-cold open bottle of a very good Chablis. We passed both bottle and joint among us, enjoying the break.

Christina said, "Ok you boys, I'm pretty stoned and I'd like a little bedroom time with you two."

We entered the bedroom and Christina got on the bed on her back. She has an amazing body that is a pleasure to look at. Jon was standing on one side of her, me on the other. Jon brought his cock to her mouth and she began to suck him. I watched her give him pleasure as I slowly jacked myself. Christina was masturbating, enjoying both the sucking and being watched.

I said to Christina, "Can I fuck you?" She pulled Jon's cock from her mouth, then answered, "Yes, yes."

I got between her legs and inserted my cock into her. I was sitting up as I gave her long, slow strokes. The sight of Jon's cock in her mouth really had me going, fuck I was horny.

With my cock still inside of her, I lowered myself to her chest. My face was now right next to hers and I could almost feel Jon's cock slide in and out of my wife's mouth.

Jon eased his cock from her mouth, then offered it to me. He entered my mouth and throat and pushed deep inside. Jon then began to fuck my throat, my wife's face just below the junction. God I loved it.

I fucked Christina, my pubic bone grinding against her's, Jon fucking our mouths and throats. He would use her mouth then mine, on and on, on and on. All three of us were locked in a rhythm of passion.

After a bit, we were all getting tired, so Christina pulled away and asked for a short break. More weed, more wine.

Christina said to Jon, "Get on your back, I wanna ride you. Jared, would that be OK?"

"Of course, I love you both."

Jon got on his back as Christina began to mount him. I helped a little by guiding Jon's cock into my wife's pussy. Christina was sitting up, her arms extended, hands on Jon's chest. She began to grind her hips into my best friend. Of course I knew that this was her favorite position because she can control the pressure on her clitoris.

I watched on as Jon let himself be used by Christina. Jon's eyes met hers, then met mine. Jon and I watched as Christina approached her orgasm. She was grinding away, then arched her back and came very hard. Fuck it was hot watching my wife come with another man, come with my best friend.

Christina's chest was heaving as she drew in breath, yet she continued to grind on him, apparently hoping for another orgasm.

Jon turned his head to me and said, "I love you man, get here beside me."

I lay down next to Jon, our faces very near to one another. Christina was above us, straddling Jon, grinding into him as she watched.

Jon pulled my face to his and we began a long, deep, wet kiss. It was a kiss filled with caring, a kiss of true friendship. The kiss lasted a long time as Christina fucked Jon. She said, "That's so hot, so hot."

Christina was covered in sweat, much of it dripping onto Jon as she had another orgasm. Her body shook with every spasm of her climax. She was pretty tired as she dismounted Jon. She said, "You guys keep going, I'm gonna watch and drink some more wine."

She got the bottle of Chablis, then pushed she the chair next to the bed, one leg slung over an arm of the chair. Her cunt was wet and wide open as she masturbated while watching Jon and me. She'd take a big slug of wine, then a hit of 'Popeye,' all the time fingering her clit as Jon and I kissed. She said, "More guys, I know you can do better."

Her words of permission were a catalyst. 

Jon kissed me even deeper, then climbing onto my chest and offered me his cock. I tilted my head up and took it into my mouth. Jon face-fucked me, one hand at the back of my head. I could feel my saliva pool on my neck. Jon was rocking his hips into my mouth, using it for his pleasure. I could hear Christina in the background encouraging him on. "Yeah, yeah, that's it, fuck that mouth."

Jon pulled loose and stood up, gathering his breath. Christina sat there in the chair, legs wide open, fingers busy. She said, "I love you both and I know you love each other. Any chance I can get you two to fuck?"

Jon stood over me stroking his cock. He said, "I'm cool if Jared is."

I answered by simply turning over and pushing my ass in the air. My back was arched, my legs were spread and my head was resting on my folded arms.

Christina got up and sat next to me facing backwards. She bent down and spread my ass-cheeks. She must have let a big gob of her saliva drip down onto my anus as I could feel it get wet.

Jon got on the bed behind me and began to massage my slick anus with his forefinger. He slowly pushed it inside of me, then added a second finger. I heard Christina say, "Hot, fucking hot."

Jon carefully massaged me there, my asshole slowly beginning to relax. Jon used his other hand to lightly massage my balls. Here I was, my wife holding my ass open, my best friend readying me me for penetration.

The bed shifted as Jon moved forwards. I could feel him rub his cock-head around my anus. He said, "Ready?" I answered, "Yeah, go ahead."

Jon began to very slowly push into me. The pressure was slow and steady, Christina aiding us by spitting down onto his cock, keeping it wet. I soon felt the stubble of his pubic hair against my ass-cheeks and knew he was fully inside of me. Christina said, "Ok, now fuck him."

She got off the bed and pulled the chair closer. She spread her legs, this time both legs high on the arms of the chair. She said, "Do it." and began to rub her clit.

Jon began to fuck me slow and long. He would pull almost all the way out, then more quickly push back in. Stroke after stroke, I could feel our passion grow. My asshole was soon relaxed and wide open as Jon began his assault. 

He was fucking me with the full length of his cock again and again. I could feel his balls slap against mine as he went fully into me. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

My cock was rock-hard as he used me, then something very odd happened... I came. 

I came without anyone touching me, the excitement and the pressure must have been enough to set me off. I arched my back and shot my load onto the sheets. Christina said, "Oh my God, oh my God."

I was in ecstasy as I turned my head to watch my wife. Her fingers were a blur as she watched the action. Her body soon contracted as she had yet another orgasm. She was shaking as she said, "Jon, cum, cum! Cum inside him."

Jon began to really pound me. Slam, slam, slam. My body was there for my friend to use and my wife to look at. It's hard to describe my state-of-mind, I was so lost with lust and love.

Jon was making animal-like noises above me when he suddenly pulled my hips tight to his and emptied his seed into me. He gave me short, deep thrusts with each jet of his orgasm. Bang, bang, bang.

He fell back on lay on the bed. All three of us were panting with what must have been the best sex of our lives.
